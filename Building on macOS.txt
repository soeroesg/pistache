Making Pistache on macOS
========================

Apple's clang compiler must be installed. It comes as part of
Xcode. If not already installed, at terminal command line do:
  xcode-select --install

Homebrew (also known as "brew") is required. If not already installed,
follow the Homebrew instructions to install:
  In your browser: https://brew.sh/

Then, install the necessary brew packages via terminal command line:
  brew install meson
  brew install doxygen
  brew install googletest
  brew install openssl
  brew install rapidjson
  brew install howard-hinnant-date
(You may be able to skip howard-hinnant-date)

Convenience shell scripts are provided to make the build. At terminal,
do:
  bldscripts/mesbuild.sh
To test:
  bldscripts/mestest.sh
To install:
  bldscripts/mesinstall.sh

The meaning of each convenience script is as follows:
  mesbuild.sh - build release version using meson
  mestest.sh - test release version using meson
  mesinstall.sh - install release version using meson
  
  mesbuilddebug.sh - build debug version using meson
  mestestdebug.sh - test debug version with meson
  mesinstalldebug.sh - install debug version using meson
  
  mesbuildflibev.sh - build version using meson forcing libevnet use
  mestestflibev.sh - test version using meson with libevnet use  
  mesinstallflibev.sh - install version using meson with libevnet use

  mesbuildflibevdebug.sh - build debug ver using meson forcing libevnet use
  mestestflibevdebug.sh - test debug ver using meson with libevnet use  
  mesinstallflibevdebug.sh - install debug ver using meson with libevnet use

  clean.sh - remove build directories
